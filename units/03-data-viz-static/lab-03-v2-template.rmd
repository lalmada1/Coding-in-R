# Introduction

This lab provides the code to replicate the following graphic using 
**[Gapminder](www.gapminder.org)** life expectancy data.

# Importing & Preprocessing

The following imports and merges life expectancy data and region classification 
for grouped means.

<br>

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cssearcy/AYS-R-Co",
              "ding-SPR-2020/master/LABS/gapminder_group_data.csv")

regions <- read_csv(file = url) %>%         # Import country region data
  select(Country = name,
         Region = eight_regions) %>% 
  mutate(Region = str_replace_all(string = Region, 
                                  pattern = "_", 
                                  replacement = " "),
         Region = str_to_title(Region))

url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cssearcy/AYS-R-Co",
              "ding-SPR-2020/master/LABS/gapminder_life_exp.csv")

life_exp <- read_csv(file = url) %>%        # Import, merge life expectancy data
  pivot_longer(cols = -country) %>% 
  rename("Country" = country, 
         "Year" = name, 
         "Lifespan" = value) %>% 
  left_join(regions) %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year)) %>% 
  select(Region, Country, Year, Lifespan) %>% 
  arrange(Region, Country, Year, Lifespan)

```

<br>
<br>

## Group Preprocessing

Using package `dplyr`, we can quickly create two additional tables needed to 
recreate the various series over time, one for overall life expectancy and 
eight according to *Gapminder's* eightfold regional classifications.

<br>

```{r}

region_avgs <- life_exp %>% 
  group_by(Year, Region) %>% 
  summarize(Average = mean(Lifespan, 
                           na.rm = TRUE))          # Expectancy by year, region

year_avg <- life_exp %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(Average = mean(Lifespan, 
                           na.rm = TRUE))          # Expectancy by year only
  
```

<br>
<br>

# Replication

The following recreates the *Gapminder* graphic as closely as possible. The 
foundation code for either package `graphics` or `ggplot2` are provided below.

**Note:** *You may replicate the graphic step-by-step or in a single code chunk.*

<br>

### Package "ggplot2"

```{r fig.align = "center"}

ggplot(life_exp, aes(x = Year, 
                     y = Lifespan)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.025,
             color = "grey50") +
  theme_minimal()

```

<br>
<br>

### Package "graphics"

```{r fig.align = "center"}

plot.new()

plot.window(xlim = c(min(life_exp$Year, na.rm = TRUE), 
                     max(life_exp$Year, na.rm = TRUE)),
            ylim = c(min(life_exp$Lifespan, na.rm = TRUE),
                     max(life_exp$Lifespan, na.rm = TRUE))) # Specify dimensions

points(life_exp$Year, 
       life_exp$Lifespan,
       col = alpha(colour = "grey80", 
                   alpha = 0.15))

```

# Tips & Tricks

Consider the following tips for completing this assignment.

<br>

### Replication Checklist

Ensure you've performed the following to replicate the NYT graphic as closely as possible.

1. Contextually plot all average life expectancy for each country and year
2. Name the x-axis "Year" and y-axis "Life Expectancy (Years)"
3. Ensure that the y-axis is between 0 and 100 years
    - Label should include 0, 25, 50, and 75
4. Ensure that the y-axis is between 1800 and 2100
    - Label should include 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100
5. Ensue the following labels are used:
    - Title: "Average Life Expectancy Over Time"
    - Subtitle: Overall & 8 Region Averages"
    - Caption: "Source: www.gapminder.org"
6. Plot group average lines for each of the 8 *Gapminder* regions
7. Plot an overall average with `'col = dodgerblue'` and a white outline
8. Draw lines and annotate the ends of World Wars I & II

<br>

### Arguments, Arguments, Arguments!

Each function requires several arguments (modifications inside the `()`) to 
replicate the graphic. Remember to use `help()`.

<br>

```{r eval = FALSE}

help(mtext)

```

# How to Submit

Use the following instructions to submit your assignment, which may vary depending on your course's platform.

<br>

### Knitting to HTML

When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report.

<br>

### Special Instructions

Perform the following depending on your course's platform:

* **Canvas:** Upload both your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files to the appropriate link
* **Blackboard or iCollege:** Compress your `.RMD` and `.HTML` files in a `.ZIP` file and upload to the appropriate link

`.HTML` files are preferred but not allowed by all platforms.

<br>

### Before You Submit

Remember to ensure the following before submitting your assignment.

1. Name your files using this format: **Lab-##-LastName.rmd** and **Lab-##-LastName.html**
2. Show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text 
3. Do not show excessive output; truncate your output, e.g. with function `head()`
4. Follow appropriate styling conventions, e.g. spaces after commas, etc.
5. Above all, ensure that your conventions are consistent

See [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) for examples of common conventions.

<br>
<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.
